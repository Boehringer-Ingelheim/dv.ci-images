# Docker Images for CI

[![Build and Publish Image](https://github.com/Boehringer-Ingelheim/dv.ci-images/actions/workflows/build_push.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Boehringer-Ingelheim/dv.ci-images/actions/workflows/build_push.yml) [![Check and Lint Repo](https://github.com/Boehringer-Ingelheim/dv.ci-images/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Boehringer-Ingelheim/dv.ci-images/actions/workflows/check.yml)

Docker images that will be used for CI purposes via GitHub Actions.

## How it works

The [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) acts as a template and accepts input arguments like the R version, CRAN snapshot date, linux distribution name and (LTS) version.

The [scripts](./scripts/) folder contains scripts that add R packages and system dependencies to make the final image fit for purpose.

Github Actions [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) support the image building workflows.
